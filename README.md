# Programmer QWERTY

## Why?

Because relearning all of my letter and number keys for Dvorak or Colemak is just too much, creating friction for others to use my keyboard for basic typing (and for me to use others' keyboards).

Given that I code for a living, I wanted to reduce how often I needed to use modifiers to access my bracket pairs, as well as spread the opening and closing brackets across both hands to increase speed.

As I use them more frequently than numbers, I have also moved the numbers to the shift layer.

This keyboard layout was created using [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) v3.5.12, and with inspiration from [ThePrimeagen's Programmers Dvorak keyboard layout](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards).

## Installation
